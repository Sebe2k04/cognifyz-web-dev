                <p id="ai">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative field in computer science that seeks to create intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. AI encompasses a wide range of applications, from narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks like voice assistants and recommendation systems, to the aspirational goal of achieving General AI, where machines possess human-like intelligence and adaptability. Machine learning, a subset of AI, plays a pivotal role by enabling algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. AI has made significant strides in natural language processing, computer vision, healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, offering innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and decision-making. However, ethical concerns regarding bias, privacy, and transparency in AI systems are growing in importance as this technology continues to reshape our world.</p>
